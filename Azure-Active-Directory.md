## Conclusion

This lab provided practical, hands-on experience with foundational Azure Active Directory (now Microsoft Entra ID) administration. You created and managed users, assigned licenses, configured groups, and applied role-based access control (RBAC) through directory roles. You also explored Azure AD security features such as conditional access, monitoring sign‑in activity, and reviewing audit logs to understand identity-related events.

By completing these tasks, you gained exposure to the core responsibilities of identity and access management within a cloud environment, verifying the right users have the right access while maintaining security and compliance. This lab demonstrates essential skills for managing identities, enforcing governance, and supporting a secure Azure AD/Entra ID infrastructure in real-world enterprise environments.
